## Introduction
- For this workshop 4, there was something that I've never done which was colour changing, with using the slider. So, for this project so far, I decided to follow the identical code that Leo did in the lecture. https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-2-overview?module_item_id=2435968.
- I wanted to try to do an unchallenging one, exploring more on colour change shifting.
- There arenâ€™t many references for Workshop 4 because it was mainly based on the lecture. I learned by doing and experiencing the tasks directly relying onto the lecture, which allowed me to do it step by step.

**Coding at the moment, this part is where there was some confusion on the function preload(){ because the image didn't appeared but only showed the extra close-up of the image.**
- I began to research on www.google.com on 'p5.js image resize.' and got some good info and exactly what I wanted.

- First, there were two errors on for the first code:
```ruby
function preload(){
```
which was the **img=loadImage("photo/night.jpg)**, because I have encountered the folder wrong before in the sketch **(img=loadImage (images/night.jpg)**. After fixing that problem, I worked on the photo size. For the photo size, I decided to reduce it and crop the image to better fit the sketch.
```ruby
img.resize(400,400);
}
```
and it fits perfectly, and I was quite impressed on how the code worked.

## Conclusion(+ further improvement)
- For further improvement, it would be helpful to double-check the codes and review what might be missing, including the files. And for this current simple sketch, I would love to try make it more visually appealing by designing the code with more colours, textbox including the layouts too.
- But for today's workshop, it was quite diverting, and I've learnt about how to make a slider. Event though I didn't quite get to learnt from the end part from the video, or even expanding more ideas on what to add for this collage, I would love to try that and see how it goes for the next assignment.
